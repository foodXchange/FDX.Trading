### 5. Verification Queries
```sql

-- Check recently imported suppliers
SELECT TOP 10 SupplierName, ProductCategory, Country 
FROM FoodXSuppliers 
WHERE Id > 25900 
ORDER BY Id DESC;

-- Verify no demo data remains
SELECT Email FROM AspNetUsers 
WHERE Email LIKE '%@test.%' OR Email LIKE '%demo%';
-- Result: 0 records
```

### 6. Files Created/Modified

### 7. Next Steps
