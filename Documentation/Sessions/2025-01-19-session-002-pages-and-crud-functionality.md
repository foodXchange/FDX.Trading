## Issues & Resolutions

### Issues Encountered
1. **Issue**: Compilation errors with MudBlazor generic type parameters
   - **Cause**: MudBlazor components require explicit T parameter
   - **Resolution**: Added T="string" to all MudChip, MudTextField, MudSelect components
   - **Time Spent**: 30 minutes

2. **Issue**: ReadOnly attribute syntax errors in MyCompany.razor
   - **Cause**: Incorrect syntax for boolean expressions in attributes
   - **Resolution**: Changed from ReadOnly="!isEditing" to ReadOnly="@(!isEditing)"
   - **Time Spent**: 20 minutes

3. **Issue**: Microsoft login prompt on every build
   - **Cause**: Connection string using Active Directory Interactive
   - **Resolution**: Changed to Active Directory Default to use cached Azure CLI credentials
   - **Time Spent**: 15 minutes

4. **Issue**: Process lock preventing builds
   - **Cause**: FoodX.Admin.exe still running from previous builds
   - **Resolution**: Kill process using PowerShell before rebuilding
   - **Time Spent**: 10 minutes

### Unresolved Issues
1. **Issue**: MudDialogInstance not found in MudBlazor v8
   - **Impact**: Add dialogs cannot close properly
   - **Proposed Solution**: Refactor to use DialogService pattern without MudDialogInstance

## Testing

- [x] Tests executed:
  - Manual build verification
  - Route accessibility testing
  - Compilation error resolution

‚è≥ Implement Delete functionality
‚è≥ Add validation to forms
‚è≥ Connect to actual data for Products page

### Blockers
üö´ MudDialogInstance type not available in MudBlazor v8

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)

2. Complete CRUD operations for all entities
3. Test all Add/Edit/Delete operations

### Short-term (This Week)

- Create edit dialogs
- Implement delete confirmation dialogs
- Add pagination to list pages

### Long-term (This Sprint/Month)

## Notes & Observations

### Technical Notes
- MudBlazor v8 has different dialog handling than v7
- Azure AD authentication can be cached using Azure CLI
- .NET 9 requires explicit generic type parameters for MudBlazor components
- Collection property setters cause CA2227 warnings

### Business Notes
- 30 test users already exist across 6 roles
- Products need to be linked to existing companies/suppliers
- Role structure is comprehensive (Buyers, Suppliers, Experts, Agents, SystemAdmins, BackOffice)

### Recommendations
- Consider upgrading to MudBlazor v7 for better dialog support
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add logging for all CRUD operations
- Consider implementing a repository pattern for data access

- Tasks Completed: 3.5 (dialogs created but not fully functional)
- Completion Rate: 87.5%
- Blockers Encountered: 4
